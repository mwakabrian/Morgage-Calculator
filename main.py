# Morgage Calculator

# Using the Loan Amortization formula below,

# M = P[i(1+i)^n]/(1+i)^n - 1]

# Where:
# M = Total monthly payment -7452.81
# P = Total principal loan amount - $100,000
# i = % monthly interest rate -7.5% (0.075 as a decimal)
# n = number of payments (loan duration in months)-30 years, so 30 * 12 = 360 months
